;; Rule for introducing
;;
;; IntensionalSimilarityLink
;;   A
;;   B
;;
;; based on direct evidence of patterns between A and B, where a
;; pattern of A is a super set of A with a description shorter than A.
;;
;; A
;; B
;; precondition: there exists X, (Attraction A X) and (Attraction B X)
;; |-
;; IntensionalSimilarity <TV>
;;   A
;;   B
;;
;; where TV is
;;
;; ExtensionSimilarityLink <TV>
;;   patterns-of(A)
;;   patterns-of(B)
;;
;; patterns-of(A) is defined as the satifying set of pattern-of(X,A)
;; over X, where pattern-of(X,A) is calculated as follows
;;
;;   pattern-of(X,A) = s(X) × (P(X|A)-P(X|¬A))+
;;
;; where s(X) is the prior of X, reflecting it's simplicity. Thus the
;; simpler X is and the stronger the discriminating power of X over A
;; is, the more X is a pattern of A. Also, (x)+ is the posivitive part
;; of x, see
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_negative_parts.
;;
;; For the discriminating power of X over A, we also say that A is
;; attracted to pattern X, which can be represented with
;;
;; AttractionLink
;;   A
;;   X
;;
;; Although not present in the premises, this rule requires all
;; relevant attraction links to be present in the atomspace in order
;; to correctly calculate the TV.

;; TODO: in order to add the Attraction links in the premises maybe an
;; idea would be to introduce a has-closure predicate, such as
;;
;; Evaluation (stv 1 1)
;;   Predicate "has-closure"
;;   (Lambda X (Attraction A X))
;;
;; and
;;
;; Evaluation (stv 1 1)
;;   Predicate "has-closure"
;;   (Lambda X (Attraction B X))
;;
;; Or maybe even introduce a HasClosureLink, such as
;;
;; (HasClosureLink (stv 1 1)
;;   X
;;   (Attraction A X))
